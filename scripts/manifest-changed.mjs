 * Decide whether a regenerated manifest is worth proposing.

 * `generatedAt` moves on every run, so a manifest rebuilt from upstream data that has not changed
 * still looks different to `git diff`. Nineteen of the twenty commits on main before this landed were
 * exactly that: a pull request, a full CI run and a production deploy, to move one timestamp forward.
 * At a daily cron that is merely noise; at the half-hourly one the community snapshot now runs on it
 * would be forty-eight empty commits a day.
 *
 * The timestamp still ships. It just stops being a reason to deploy on its own, which means the
 * displayed 数据获取时间 is when the published numbers were actually read, not when they were last
 * confirmed unchanged.
